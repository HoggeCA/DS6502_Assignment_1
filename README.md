This is where I am uploading the source code for DS6502 data analysis and visualisation assignment 1, as well as the dataset that we found on kaggle.
The source code contains the instructiuons to install and load the proper libraries, load the dataset from salaries.csv, calculate descriptive statistics and generate five tables that answer different questions relating to the dataset which have been asked in the reports.
I have provided both the excel data and the source code file itself on this website.
